Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
Description:
For this lab, we were asked to create a tokenizer.
I used the files uimain, tokenizer, history, and Makefile. 
**The uimain file handled all the user inputs and the front-end logic of my tokenizer.
**The tokenizer file handled the functionality of the tokenizer itself, it has several methods in which I handled how to divide my tokens, how to know how many tokens the input had, etc.
** The history file handled the history of the tokenizer, I used a liked list to allocate the history, as well as a counter. This code has methods such as get_history that allow the user to retrieve a specific token using an identifier, and if that identifier does not exist it returns a message instead of an error.
